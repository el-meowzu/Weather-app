☀️🌧️ Weather App 🌍🌩️

👋 Hi Welcome to the **Weather App**! This app was built using **React**, **Express**, and **Node.js**, with a sprinkle of **CSS** for styling. 
The objective of this project is to deploy the app using **Vercel** and securely hide my API key by creating a mini backend with **Express**. 🌟

I used **Axios** to make API requests a breeze! 💨

## 🌐 Live Demo

## 🚀 Features
- 🌤️ Fetches real-time weather data
- 📍 Search for your city to get the current weather
- 🔒 API key securely hidden via backend
- 🎨 Simple and clean UI built with basic CSS
- 💨 Axios to handle API requests smoothly

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React** ⚛️ for the frontend
- **Node.js** and **Express** 🛠️ for the backend
